Everywhere I look, people are saying, "Computer science is not a valuable skill anymore—it's all going to be replaced by AI." I think they're wrong. I believe pursuing computer science is still valuable in a world of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence.

Second: because AI should be treated as just another layer of abstraction.
